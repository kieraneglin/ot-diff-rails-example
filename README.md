# OT-Diff example
A Rails app showing off my [OT-Diff](https://github.com/kieraneglin/ot-diff) library.  Check it out here! https://ot-diff.herokuapp.com/posts/1/edit

Open this link in two tabs (or with a friend) and test out the live editing.  

## Note:
Text isn't saved, since this is public and unsecured.  So if you want to get the full experience make sure you and your friend start with a blank textarea.
